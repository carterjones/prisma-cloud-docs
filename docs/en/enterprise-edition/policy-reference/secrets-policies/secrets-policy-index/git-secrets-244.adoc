=== Description

A Replicate user access token is a credential that allows access to your Replicate account and resources. If this token is exposed, unauthorized users could potentially access your account, run models, view your billing information, or even delete your account. 

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Replicate user access token*

To address an exposed Replicate user access token:

1. **Regenerate the Token:** Immediately navigate to your Replicate account settings and generate a new user access token. This will invalidate the previously exposed token.
2. **Securely Store the New Token:** Store the new access token in a secure manner, such as using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management solution. Avoid hardcoding the token directly in your code.

Regularly audit your codebase for exposed secrets and employ security scanning tools to help identify and mitigate such risks proactively.
