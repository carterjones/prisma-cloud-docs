=== Description

A Plaid access token is a sensitive credential that allows an application to access a user's financial data via the Plaid API. Exposing this token could allow unauthorized access to sensitive financial information, such as bank account details and transaction history.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Plaid access token*

To remediate the exposure of a Plaid access token:

1. **Revoke the Exposed Token:** Immediately revoke the compromised access token from your Plaid dashboard. This will prevent further unauthorized access using the exposed token. 
2. **Generate a New Access Token:** Generate a new access token with the appropriate scope and duration for your application's needs.
3. **Securely Store the New Token:** Avoid hardcoding the new access token directly in your code. Instead, use environment variables or a dedicated secret management solution to store and manage sensitive credentials. 

Remember to review your codebase and configurations regularly for exposed secrets and follow security best practices to protect sensitive credentials.
