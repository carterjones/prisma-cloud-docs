=== Description

The Salesforce Refresh Token is a critical credential used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to log in again, allowing seamless integration and continuous access to Salesforce APIs. Exposing this token can lead to unauthorized access to your Salesforce account, potentially compromising sensitive business data and disrupting operations. To ensure the security of your Salesforce integration, it is essential to manage your Refresh Token securely and regularly review your security practices to prevent any unauthorized usage. For comprehensive security guidelines and best practices regarding Salesforce Refresh Token management, refer to the latest documentation and support resources available in the https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_oauth_refresh_token_flow.htm[Salesforce documentation and support].

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Salesforce*

If your Salesforce Refresh Token is exposed, it's crucial to take immediate action to prevent any unauthorized use. Revoke the compromised token through your Salesforce account and generate a new token to replace the exposed one in all relevant applications. By revoking a compromised Salesforce Refresh Token and updating your application integrations, you not only secure your Salesforce API access but also maintain the confidentiality and integrity of your business data.

After updating the token, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Salesforce Refresh Token to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
