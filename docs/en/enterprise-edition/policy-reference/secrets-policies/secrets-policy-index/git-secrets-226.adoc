=== Description

Slack bot tokens are sensitive credentials that grant access to your Slack workspace. If a Slack bot token is exposed, unauthorized individuals could potentially use it to access and manipulate your Slack workspace, including sending messages, accessing files, and even inviting new users.

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Slack bot token*

If you've identified a Slack bot token in your code, it's essential to take immediate action:

1. **Invalidate the Exposed Token:**  Immediately revoke the compromised token from your Slack workspace settings. This will prevent further unauthorized access.
2. **Generate a New Token:** Create a new bot token for your Slack app, ensuring you follow Slack's best practices for security.
3. **Securely Store the New Token:**  Avoid hardcoding the new token directly in your code. Instead, use a secure storage mechanism like environment variables or a secrets management solution.

Regularly audit your codebase and configurations for exposed secrets and leverage automated security scanning tools to help identify and mitigate these risks proactively.
