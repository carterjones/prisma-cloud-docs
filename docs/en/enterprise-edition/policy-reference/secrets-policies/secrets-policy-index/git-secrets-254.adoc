=== Description

Exposing a Zapier webhook URL in your code can be risky. Unauthorized individuals could potentially discover this URL and use it to trigger actions in your Zapier integrations, leading to unintended consequences or data manipulation. 

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Zapier webhook url*

To mitigate the risks associated with exposed Zapier webhook URLs:

1. **Regenerate Your Webhook URL:** If you suspect your Zapier webhook URL has been compromised, regenerate it from your Zapier account. This will invalidate the old URL.
2. **Securely Handle Webhook Requests:** Implement authentication or verification mechanisms within your application's webhook handling logic to ensure that requests originating from the webhook URL are legitimate.

By taking these precautions, you can enhance the security of your Zapier integrations and protect your workflows from unauthorized access.
