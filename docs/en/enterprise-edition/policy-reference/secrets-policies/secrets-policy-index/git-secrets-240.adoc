*New Relic APM license key*

Protect your New Relic APM license key by taking the following steps:

1. **Regenerate Your License Key:** Immediately regenerate your New Relic APM license key from your New Relic account settings. This will invalidate the exposed key.
2. **Securely Store the New Key:** Store the new license key in a secure manner, such as using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management solution.
3. **Review Access Permissions:**  Audit the users and services that have access to your New Relic account and data, ensuring that access is limited to authorized personnel and applications only.
