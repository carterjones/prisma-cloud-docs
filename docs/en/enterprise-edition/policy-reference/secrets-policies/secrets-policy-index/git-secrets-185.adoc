=== Description

Eventbrite OAuth 2.0 keys are sensitive credentials used for authentication and authorization in applications that integrate with Eventbrite services. Exposing these keys can lead to unauthorized access to user data and compromise the security of your application and user accounts. 

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Eventbrite Oauth2 Keys*

If your Eventbrite OAuth2 keys are exposed, rotate them immediately.  You can do this by following these steps:
1. Go to the Eventbrite Developer Portal (https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api/).
2. Select your app.
3. Navigate to the "API Keys" or "Credentials" section.
4. Locate the exposed keys and click on the "Regenerate" or "Rotate" button. 

After updating the key, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Eventbrite OAuth2 keys to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
