=== Description

Yahoo OAuth 2.0 keys are sensitive credentials used for authentication and authorization in applications that integrate with Yahoo services. Exposing these keys can lead to unauthorized access to user data and compromise the security of your application and user accounts. 

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Yahoo OAuth2 Keys*

If your Yahoo OAuth2 keys are exposed, rotate them immediately.  You can do this by following these steps:
1. Go to the Yahoo Developer Console ([https://developer.yahoo.com/apps](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps)).
2. Select your app.
3. Click on the "Security" tab.
4. Under "OAuth 2.0 Credentials," click on the "Rotate" button next to the client ID and client secret that you need to rotate.

After updating the key, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Yahoo OAuth2 Keys to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
