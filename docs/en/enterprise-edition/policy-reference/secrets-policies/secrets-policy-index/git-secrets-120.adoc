=== Description

A Discord Webhook URL allows external applications to send messages to a Discord channel. It acts as a security endpoint for your Discord server, enabling integrations with external services to post messages directly into your Discord channels. Exposing this URL can lead to unauthorized access, spam, and potential misuse of your Discord server. To ensure the security of your Discord server, it is critical to manage your Webhook URLs securely and periodically review your security practices to prevent any unauthorized usage. For comprehensive security guidelines and best practices regarding Discord Webhook URL management, refer to the latest documentation and support resources available in the https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook[Discord documentation and support].

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Discord*

If your Discord Webhook URL is exposed, it's crucial to take immediate action to prevent any unauthorized use. Regenerate a new Webhook URL through your Discord account and replace the exposed URL with the new URL in all relevant applications. By regenerating a compromised Discord Webhook URL and updating your application integrations, you not only secure your Discord server but also maintain the confidentiality and integrity of your communications.

1. Log into your Discord account with administrator credentials.

2. Navigate to the 'Server Settings' section for the server containing the exposed Webhook URL.

3. Identify the affected Webhook and delete it.
NOTE: Ensure that deleting your Webhook does not break any integrations.

4. Select 'Create Webhook' to generate a new Webhook URL. Provide a name for the new Webhook and save the changes.

5. Update all applications and services that use the Discord Webhook URL with the new URL values, ensuring the new URL is not exposed in public repositories or hardcoded in your source code.

After updating the URL, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Discord Webhook to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
