=== Description

The Octopus Deploy API Key is a critical credential used to access Octopus Deploy's deployment automation services. Exposing this key can lead to unauthorized access, allowing malicious actors to manipulate your deployment processes and potentially causing severe disruptions and data breaches. To maintain the security of your Octopus Deploy integration, it is essential to manage your API Key securely and regularly review your security practices to prevent any unauthorized usage.

*Octopus Deploy*

If your Octopus Deploy API Key is exposed, it's crucial to take immediate action to prevent any unauthorized use. Regenerate a new key through your Octopus Deploy account and replace the exposed key with the new key in all relevant applications. By regenerating a compromised Octopus Deploy API Key and updating your application integrations, you not only secure your deployment processes but also maintain the confidentiality and integrity of your services.

1. Log into your Octopus Deploy account with administrator credentials.

2. Navigate to the 'My API Keys' section within your user settings.

3. Identify the exposed key and delete it.
NOTE: Ensure that deleting your key does not disrupt any applications or services.

4. Create a new API key. Provide the necessary information and save the changes.

5. Update all applications and services that use the Octopus Deploy API Key with the new key values, ensuring the new key is not exposed in public repositories or hardcoded in your source code.

After updating the key, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Octopus Deploy API Key to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
