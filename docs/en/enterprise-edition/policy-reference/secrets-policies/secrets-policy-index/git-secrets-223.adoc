=== Description

Storing SSH passwords directly in your code is extremely risky. If this code is committed to a repository or shared, it allows anyone with access to the code to potentially gain unauthorized access to your servers. 

=== Fix - Buildtime

*SSH Password*

**Never store SSH passwords directly in your code.** Here are safer alternatives:

1. **SSH Keys:** Use SSH key pairs for authentication. Generate a public and private key pair. Place the public key on the server you want to access and keep the private key secure.
2. **Secrets Management Solutions:** Utilize dedicated secrets management solutions like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault. These tools securely store and manage sensitive credentials.
3. **Environment Variables:** In development environments, you can temporarily use environment variables to store the SSH password. However, avoid this practice in production.

Remember to change the compromised SSH password immediately if it was stored insecurely. Additionally, audit your server logs for any suspicious login attempts.
