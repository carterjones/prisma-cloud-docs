=== Description

The Okta Client Secret is a critical credential used in OAuth and OpenID Connect flows to authenticate applications and services with Okta. Exposing this secret can lead to unauthorized access, allowing malicious actors to exploit your authentication mechanisms and potentially compromising sensitive data and services. To maintain the security of your Okta integration, it is essential to manage your Client Secret securely and regularly review your security practices to prevent any unauthorized usage. For comprehensive security guidelines and best practices regarding Okta Client Secret management, refer to the latest documentation and support resources available in the https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/main/[Okta documentation and support].

=== Fix - Buildtime

*Okta*

If your Okta Client Secret is exposed, it's crucial to take immediate action to prevent any unauthorized use. Regenerate a new secret through your Okta account and replace the exposed secret with the new secret in all relevant applications. By regenerating a compromised Okta Client Secret and updating your application integrations, you not only secure your authentication mechanisms but also maintain the confidentiality and integrity of your services.

1. Log into your Okta account with administrator credentials.

2. Navigate to the 'Applications' section and select the affected application.

3. Identify the exposed Client Secret and regenerate a new secret.
NOTE: Ensure that regenerating your secret does not disrupt any applications or services.

4. Save the new secret securely and ensure it is not hardcoded in your source code or exposed in public repositories.

5. Update all applications and services that use the Okta Client Secret with the new secret values.

After updating the secret, it is recommended to audit all recent uses of the Okta Client Secret to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activities. This will help you assess the impact of the exposure and enhance your security measures.
