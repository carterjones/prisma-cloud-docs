=== Description


GCP GitHub Actions OIDC trust policies must be properly configured to ensure security and reduce risks related to unauthorized access or vulnerabilities introduced by misconfigurations. Poorly configured policies might allow unauthorized access via the misuse of wildcards, abusable claims, or incorrectly structured repository claims.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 


* *Resource:*  google_iam_workload_identity_pool_provider
* *Arguments:* role

To mitigate this issue, make sure your `google_iam_workload_identity_pool_provider` resource is properly configured without insecure claims.

- Avoid wildcards (`*`) or unsafe claim structures.
- Ensure claims follow safe and restricted formats. Abusable claims include: "workflow", "environment", "ref", "context", "head_ref", "base_ref"
- Use a specific repository reference.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "google_iam_workload_identity_pool_provider" "example" {
  ...
  issuer_uri = "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
  attribute_mapping = {
    "google.subject" = "assertion.sub"
  }
-  attribute_condition = "assertion.sub == 'repo:*'"
+  attribute_condition = "assertion.sub == 'repo:organization/repository'"
}
----
