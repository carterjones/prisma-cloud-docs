=== Changes in Existing Behavior
//CWP-62948
A fix is being implemented in Prisma Cloud to remove outdated assets that are no longer protected by a Defender. These assets should have been automatically deleted previously, but were not. 

With this update, you might notice that certain stale assets are no longer present in your inventory. As a result, you might also see a drop in vulnerabilities and compliance findings due to their removal.
