=== Intelligence Stream Updates

==== Enhancements to Vulnerability Reporting for RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Versions 8 and 9
//CWP-30827
To ensure accurate vulnerability reporting, Intelligence Stream will include RPM module and stream information for RHEL. This approach improves detection of vulnerabilities and ensures that all associated RPM packages installed by a module are examined for the scan.

*What are RPM Modules and Streams?*

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), an RPM module is a collection of related RPM packages that represent a software component, such as an application, its dependencies, and helper utilities. Modules have replaced the Software Collections mechanism from RHEL Versions 6 and 7.

Modules are structured as follows:

* *Module Streams*: Virtual repositories within the AppStream repository. Each stream corresponds to a specific version of the module and receives independent updates.
* *Stream Activation*: At any time, only one stream of a module can be active, meaning only one version of a component can be installed on a system.

For example:
`python39:3.9/python39` indicates the module `python39`, stream `3.9`, and source package `python39`.

*Enhancements to Vulnerability Reporting*

* *Module-Based Vulnerability Identification*: Scans will report vulnerabilities based on the module and stream configuration. This ensures accurate detection and avoids false positives or false negatives caused by discrepancies in versioning or backported fixes.

* *Inclusion of RPM Module Metadata in Scan Results*: The enhanced implementation associates RPM packages with their respective modules and streams. The Prisma Cloud console will include this module information in vulnerability scan results.


*Benefits of Module-Aware Vulnerability Reporting*

* *Improved Accuracy*: Matches CVE fixes to the correct module stream.
* *Reduced False Positives*: Avoids misreporting of vulnerabilities fixed in older streams.
* *Comprehensive Coverage*: Links all RPM packages installed by a module to its vulnerabilities.

==== Enhanced Vulnerability Reporting for NuGet Packages 
//CWP-49786
This update improves the NuGet package scanning process to reduce false positive alerts. Previously, the scans included NuGet packages listed in the `.deps.json` files, which were essential for the runtime environment but not related to the application itself. These unrelated packages contributed to false positives in vulnerability reporting. 

With this enhancement, the scanning process excludes runtime-specific dependencies. This provides a more accurate view of vulnerabilities directly associated with the application. 


*NOTE*: 

* This enhancement requires upgrading Defenders to the latest version. 

* The updated Defender accurately identifies package dependencies, which results in fewer false positives.

* Older Defender versions will not be affected by this change, and their behavior will remain unchanged.
