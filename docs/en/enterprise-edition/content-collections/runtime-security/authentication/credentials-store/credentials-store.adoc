== Credentials Store

Prisma Cloud allows your container environments to integrate with multiple third-party services across different cloud providers. To enhance accessibility and reusability, all integration credentials are centrally managed on the *Credentials Store* page under Manage > Authentication > Credentials Store.

=== Supported Integrations
The Credentials Store manages credentials used for:

* Scanning container registries, serverless functions, and other environments
* Sending alerts via third-party services (e.g., Slack, ServiceNow, email)
* Deploying and managing Defender DaemonSets
* Injecting secrets into running containers

The following diagram shows the architecture of the the credentials store.

=== Updating Credentials

If credentials are actively in use, they cannot be deleted. To check where a credential is being used, select an entry from the credentials table and review the Usages list.

You can refresh a credentialâ€™s values without deleting and reconfiguring the integration. If an integration relies on a credential and you update its parameters (e.g., username, password), Prisma Cloud automatically propagates the new values across the relevant modules.

=== Managing Cloud Account Credentials

Prisma Cloud maintains a clear distinction between third-party integration credentials and cloud account credentials, ensuring secure and efficient credential management. Cloud account credentials are not stored in the Credentials Store (Manage > Authentication > Credentials Store).

However, you can onboard cloud provider accounts within the Runtime Security component from the Manage > Cloud Accounts page.
